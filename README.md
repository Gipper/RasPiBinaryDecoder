RasPiBinaryDecoder
==================

Looks for HIGH/LOW/BASE values from GPIO pin 18 of a RaspberryPi and translates binary into displayed string.

A very quick build using Adafruit's Learning build and PyGame to read and display info on screen. If you are using Adafruit's Pi Distro, all modules should be included already. :)
